                              His texts offer different forms and genres: dramatic poems, intimate epics,

                              main landmarks. Dramas and farces come together to represent our world, our
                              myths.</p>

                              and Photography (1997-2002). She did Erasmus Programme at Fine Arts in<em> Université Paris 8, France and completed a

                              <p>Since early on in her
                              practice, her work has been based on forms of fragmental narrative, ordinary
                              snapshots and imaginary characters that linger in between the familiar and the
                              eerie. In her meticulously crafted dioramas and small scale installations, constructed worlds come together as a
                              staged scene, often with the use of a media variety, such as mircosculpture,
                              sound, animation, light and motion. Throughout the years, there has been an
                              increase of attention to the craft and minute detail
                              within her work, while cinema, painting and photography are some of the most
                              prominent influences and aesthetic loans.</p>
